            I build software solutions and applications. I am a software
            developer.
          </p>
          <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            I have always had a knack for computers and their endless
            possibilities, which led me down some interesting paths and brought
            me to where I am today. And, I am really glad I made those choices!
            I believe an individual is way more productive when he/she is
            passionate about their work. That passion for all things software
            turned my professional life into a breezy adventure and helped me
            rack up some pretty cool achievements along the way.{" "}
          </p>
          <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            I have learned about software through both formal education and
            professional journey. After finishing my undergraduate computer science degree,
            I worked at Tata Consultancy Services where I helped develope a
            insurance web app for USAA Financial Services Company. Working there
            made me realize there is still so much more to learn, which is why I
            decided to pursue further studies.
          </p>
          <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Now, I am a student pursuing my Masters degree in Computer Science
            at Arizona State University. But I never confined myself to just academics—I’m more of a hands-on learner. 
            I joined a startup called Verix (formerly Virtualness) as a Backend Engineer,
            and the experience has been invaluable. It gave me a whole new perspective on software development.
